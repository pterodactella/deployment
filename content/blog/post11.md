## How many times the characters say their favorite lines?

Having watched the office, we cannot help but to analyse the most popular sentences that identify the main characters. 

#### **That's what shes said**

Let's start by looking at Michaels most popular joke: *That's what she said*. 

Since this joke became so popular, we will start by looking at which characters said it throughout all the 9 seasons.

The number of That's what she said jokes starts in season 2 and grows until season 4, then the joke is not said so often anymore. In season 8, when Michael leaves, no one says it. 

Then, in season 9, it is said again Once by Michael and once by Creed. 

Let's now look into how says it the most:

How many times does **Michael** say it?

#### **Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam**
As the receptionist, for the first 4 seaons, whenever Pam was answering the phone, she was said: 'Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam'. Let's look into how many times she actually said it:

#### **Number of times Angela talks about her Cats**

Angela loves cats. We found the name of her cats in the Dunderpedia page: [Angela's cats](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Angela%27s_cats), and we counted the times she said `cat`, `cats`, or any of the 18 names cats she has or has had.

#### **Number of times Andy calls Jim Tuna**

Andy Bernard had a habit of using the nickname "Big Tuna" when referring to Jim Halpert. Let's see how many times she says it throughout the seasons:

#### **Number of times Kelly calls or talks about Ryan**

Kelly is deeply in love with Ryan. However, Ryan tried to break up with Kelly multiple times unsuccessfully. Let's see how many times Kelly calls Ryan, and vice-versa.

{{< load-plotly >}}
{{< plotly json="/kaggle_imdb/26-kelly_says_ryan.json" height="250px" >}}

![Alt Text](/images/kelly.gif)

{{< load-plotly >}}
{{< plotly json="/kaggle_imdb/27-ryan_says_kelly.json" height="250px" >}}

Almost the same amount of times! We were expecting Ryan to say Kelly a significantly less amount of times than Kelly says Ryan since at some point Ryan left Scranton and went to Corporate. At this time Ryan was not talking about Kelly, but Kelly was. However, when Ryan rejoined Dunder Mifflin, Ryan got back together with Kelly.

#### **Number of Times Dwight says Assistant Regional Manager**

Dwight is a salesman, and also holds the title of Assistant **TO the** regional manager, but constantly refers to himself as "Assistant Regional Manager", attempting to elevate himself to second-in-command to branch Manager, Michael Scott.

Whenever someone refers to him as the  Assistant **TO the** the regional manager, he corrects them and says:  Assistant the regional manager. Let's see how many times he actually says it:
