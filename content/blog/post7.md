These wordclourds represent the most used words by the 16 main characters based on their Dunderpedia Wiki description.

Due to the accuracy of the word-clouds we can see a small description about everyone just by analyzing the words. Let's look at some of them individually: 

- From **Angela**'s wordcloud we can see that she mostly used cat and party, as she loved **cats** and had a lot of them, and she also was the head of **party planning committee**.


- **Michael** complained about him not being **young** anymore but when he was he used to be the **best salesman** in Dunder Mifflin, and now that he is **manager** he wants to have good **relationships** with everyone and considers the employees of Dunder Mifflin **friends** in the first place and work **colleagues** in the second.


- **Oscar**'s wordcloud most common words is **gay**, **secret**, **affair** and **Spanish** because he is a Mexican gay guy who had a secret affair with senator Lipton, and he did not want everybody to know so he had a secret kept.


- Another accurate wordcloud is for **Pam**, since she used to be a **secretary** and used a lot of bigrams and trigrams. For example, there is **day**, because she used to wish everyone a good day. We can also see **taking** because **Michael** was speaking while she was taking notes. **hair**, because of the bad hair days, and an **interview** that she attended in Philadelphia. 


- The most accurate of them all is **Stanley**'s wordcloud. From there we can see that he loved **pretzels**, doing **crosswords** and **puzzles** and needed to work because of the **money** and after that, he retired in **Florida**.


- **Dwight**'s wordcloud is also quite accurae. In his wordcloud we can she his surname: **Schrute**. Throughout the seasons, he repeately shows that he is proud of being a Schrute. He also talks a lot about the fact that he is **German**, and about the **Shrute farm** that belonged to his family in the past. Then, his goal is to become the regional **manager** of Dunder Mifflin. Until season 8, he is the Assistant (to the) regional manager, but he dreams of becoming the manager. And in the final season, he achives it. 

### **Wordlouds based on Transcripts**

We can see that the wordclouds of the majority of characters include names of other characters, specially Michael's. Since The Office is based on conversations between co-workers, it makes sense that the most comon tokens are character names. However, the main names in each character wordcloud are related to their professional of intimate relations. For example: 

- Angela had an affair with Dwight while she was daiting Andy.
- Jim is married to Pam and works close to Dwight.
- Kelly is in love with Ryan for most of the series.
- Kevin works with Angela in the Accounting department.
- Andy used to date Erin and his office budy is Darryl.
- Creed is the office weirdo and he only knows his name.
- Dwight was always pranked by Jim and he was Michael's assistant. 
- Phyllis was a salesman along with Dwight and Andy, supervised by Michael.

However, we can see that Michael do not have any character names in his word-clouds. On the other hand, Dwight has his surname: **Schrute**, which his proud of, as we previously commented.

Looking at the word-clouds generated from the transcripts, it can be seen that in some cases they do not tell much about the characters themselves, in comparison to the word-clouds obtained from the charaters's descriptions. However, they do tell about the charcter's relationships.

For example, thanks to the word-cloud from Dwight's description, we could see that he was German, he was proud of his surname, and he lives in a farm. 

From these new word-clouds, use the word Michael a lot. Then they use conversational nouns such as look, come, talk. This makes sense, since they are constantly having converstations between each other.

### **Word-clouds for all seasons**

From the wordclouds made for every season, one can not get anything catchy or of a big value. Considering that this is a sitcom and more of the time is spent on small talk and making funny conversations, the most used words are interjections and exclamation talk. However, one name constantly appears, and that is the name of Michael, which is intensly spammed during his presence. No doubt that it is used very often, as he is the character everyone is watching the show for, and one can truly say, he had a huge impact on the series ratings and views.
