### **Wordclouds based on transcripts**

Below figure is a representation of the most used words by the 25 main characters from the TV show throughout 9 seasons. 
Looking at the wordclouds not much can be said about every character, most of the characters use the words: hey, know, right, oh and yeah.It makes sense, since
they are working in the same environment and tend to have conversations betwenn each other. Whenever they approach someone they say HEY or linking words like,
oh, uh, okay. However, for some of the characters the wordcloud are quite accurate: From Angela's we can see that she mostly used Dwight and senator, whom she used to date
and Kevin that sits next to her in the office. Oscar's wordloud most used word is Angela because they both work in the same department, Jan used to be the 
secretary of the CEO which is David Wallace, Gabe used to date Erin this is why Erin is the most used word by him and Phyllis sat near Andy who after that became the manager.
Another accurate wordloud is for Pam, due to the fact that she used to be a secretary and used a lot of bigrams and trigrams and the most accurate of them all is
Stanley's wordcloud. From there we can see that he loved pies and needed to work becuase of the money and afterthat at the retirement he went to Florida.

### **Wordlouds based on Description**

We can see that the wordclouds of the majority of characters include names of other characters, especially Michael's. This is accurate considering that
Michael is the branch manager and he is in the center of attention.
Since The Office is based on conversations between co-workers, it makes sense that the most common tokens are character names. 
However, the main names in each character wordcloud are related to their professional of intimate relations. For example:

Angela had an affair with Dwight while she was daiting Andy.
Jim is married to Pam and works close to Dwight.
Kelly is in love with Ryan for most of the series.
Kevin works with Angela in the Accounting department.
Roy Anderson was engaged to Pam before Jim.
Andy used to date Erin and his office budy is Darryl.
Clark GreenÂ´s nick name is Dwight Jr and his office frinend is Pete.
Gabe Lewis used to date Erin and he worked for Sabre and in this time had two CEO's: JO and Robert.
Stanley loved crossowrds, florida and especially pretzel days.


However, we can see that Dwight and Michael do not have any character names in their word-clouds. On the other hand, Dwight has his surname: Schrute.
Thorught the seasons, he repeately shows that he is proud of being a Schrute. 
He also talkes a lot about the fact that he is german, and about the Shrute farm that belonged to his family in the past.
Michael Scott was the best salesman that is why he was appointed as branch manager, and during the show he emphasizes the importance of the relationship
with his employees, that he is not just manager but firend as well.

### **Word-clouds for all seasons**

From the wordclouds made for every season, one can not get anything catchy or of a big value. Considering that this is a sitcom and more of the time is spent on small talk and making funny conversations, the most used words are interjections and exclamation talk. However, one name constantly appears, and that is the name of Michael, which is intensly spammed during his presence. No doubt that it is used very often, as he is the character everyone is watching the show for, and one can truly say, he had a huge impact on the series ratings and views.

### **Character interactions**
The figure below shows the interaction between each character. In this graph character names are nodes and the blue line, that serves as a weighted colour depending on the number of time one character interacted with the one that is connected, are the links. If the blue colour tends to get a darker shade of blue it means that the two characters have sa stronger connection, it may be because they work in the same department or they are desk buddies and lastly they may be in a relationship. We can observe that Michael Scott hase interacted with everyone, however, not as much as he did with his assistant Dwight, or his receptionist Pam. Dwight, Pam, Jim and Michael interacted the most due to the fact the from the frist episodes they are the most engaging and constantly stories evolve around them. With every season new characters started to appear and one can see that Andy, who was not present from the begining started to catch-up with everyone but not as much as the one's from the begining. In conclusion, the more consistent the characters are present the more is likely that they interacted with everyone.
