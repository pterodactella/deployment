### Character interactions
Now that we got to know the characters a little better, we will analayse their relationships based on their interactions in their transcripts. For this, we are going to create a network based on the main character interactions. We define an interaction between two character when one character mentions the other. To analyse the mentions between characters we use the transcript dataset from Kaggle. To limit the complexity of the network, we will only use the main characters based on the Dunderpedia.

The figure below shows the interaction between each character. In this graph character names are nodes, and in blue we can see the edges. The edge weight represents the number of interations between the characters the edge connects, i.e, the stronger the blue edge is, the more interations there are between the characters. This may be because they work in the same department or they are desk buddies and lastly they may be in a relationship. We can observe that Michael Scott hase interacted with everyone, however, not as much as he did with his assistant Dwight, or his receptionist Pam. Dwight, Pam, Jim and Michael interacted the most due to the fact the from the frist episodes they are the most engaging and constantly stories evolve around them. With every season new characters started to appear and one can see that Andy, who was not present from the begining started to catch-up with everyone but not as much as the one's from the begining. In conclusion, the more consistent the characters are present the more is likely that they interacted with everyone.
