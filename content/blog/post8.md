We would like to see if based on the Dunderpedia network that we have created from the character pages, their relationships/groups can be inferred. For this we will use the  *Louvain algorithm*. Then, based on our knowledge as viewers of The Office, we are going to analyse if these communities make sense.

We can see that the identified communities make sense based on the characters and their relations. Let's look at some of the communities individually to verify:

- **Community 1: Michael Scott, Toby Flenderson, Meredith Palmer, Holly Flax and Creed Bratton.**

    Michael and Holly are married. Holly came to replace Toby when he went to Costa Rica on vacation. Hence, both Holly and Toby work in the HR department. 

- **Community 2: Andy Bernard, Kelly Kapoor, Erin Hanon, Darryl Philbin, Gabe Lewis.**

    Erin used to date Andy and Gabe and Kelly used to date Darryl. Moreover, Andy and Darryl are also office buddies.

- **Community 3: Jim Halpert, Pam Beesly, Kevin Malone, Dunder Mifflin family members and loved ones, Cecelia Halper.**

    Jim and Pam are a family and have a kid named Cecelia, together they trully are a Dunder Mifflin family.   

- **Community 4: Dwight Schrute, Oscar Martinez, Angela Martin, Robert Lipton, Mose Schrute.**

    Angela used to date Dwight and senator Lipton, in the end she ended up marrying Dwight. Moreover, Oscar also had a secret affair with the senator. Mose is the cousin of Dwight.

- **Community 5: Ryan Howard, David Wallace, Karen Filippelli, Nellie Bertram, Charles Miner.**

    All the guys from above used to work for corporate everyone being assigned as a chief to some department, or at least interviewd for a position in corporate.

- **Community 6: Jan Levinson, Michael Scarn, Astrid Levinson, Golden Face, Hunter Raymond.**

    All the above guys were a fanatsy of Michael Scott, dreams that he did not achieve he interpreted them in a movie. Howeverm, Jan used to be his girlfriend and Astrid was the daughter of Jan.

- **Community 7: Phyllis Vance, Meredith Palmer, Bob Vance, Todd Packer, Gino.**

    Phyllis and Bob Vance formed a family during the series, but Meredith and Todd had an affair while both drunk. 

- **Community 8: Stanley Hudson, Teri Hudson, Cynthia, Rose, Melissa Hudson.**

    The above community is the actual family of Stanley Hudson, Teri being his daughter and Melissa his wife. Cynthia and Rose are the two affairs Stanley had during the series.

- **Community 9: Dawn Tinsley, David Brent, Gareth Keenan, Tim Cantenbury, Donna.**

    Community nr nine is actually formed from the office group based in UK who also appear for some minutes in The Office US.

As we can see, all the communities formed make sense, because there was or still is a sepcial bond betwenn the characters in each community.
